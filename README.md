# MemoryMate: Memory Support and Alzheimer's Detection System
## Introduction
MemoryMate is a comprehensive program designed to provide memory support for the elderly, particularly those with a family history of Alzheimer's disease or those currently diagnosed with it. Our program allows users to record voice memos throughout the day, which are then used to generate memory quizzes. This not only helps users keep track of their daily activities but also serves as a tool for early detection of Alzheimer's disease through data analysis.

## Key Features
### Voice Memo Recording
Users can easily record voice memos throughout the day using our intuitive interface.
Memos are automatically timestamped and dated for reference.

### Memory Quizzes
Based on the recorded voice memos, the program generates memory quizzes to help users exercise their cognitive abilities.
Users receive random notifications throughout the day to answer questions based on their recorded memos.

### Alzheimer's Detection
Data analysis is performed over time to identify any potential signs of Alzheimer's disease based on the user's quiz results.
Caregivers are alerted if there are indications of cognitive decline, prompting them to seek medical evaluation.

### Location Tracking
Location tracking functionality allows caregivers to monitor the whereabouts of the elderly users.
Caregivers can set zones (red, green, yellow) and receive notifications if the user wanders into restricted areas, ensuring their safety.

### Safety Features
In case the user is found in a red or yellow zone, caregivers are notified immediately.
Caregivers can use the program to call for Uber/Lyft services to safely bring the user back home if they are unable to return on their own.

### Educational and Financial Resources
The website will provide access to educational and financial resources to support the well-being and independence of both people with memory issues and their caregivers.

## Conclusion
MemoryMate aims to provide comprehensive memory support and early detection of Alzheimer's disease for elderly users. With features tailored to both users and caregivers, our program ensures safety, independence, and peace of mind for all parties involved.
