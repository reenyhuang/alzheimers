                    <p class="text-muted">Based on the recorded voice memos, the program generates memory quizzes to help users exercise their cognitive abilities. Users receive random notifications throughout the day to answer questions based on their recorded memos.Data analysis is performed over time to identify any potential signs of Alzheimer's disease based on the user's quiz results. Caregivers are alerted if there are indications of cognitive decline, prompting them to seek medical evaluation.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Location tracking functionality allows caregivers to monitor the whereabouts of the elderly users. Caregivers can set zones (red, green, yellow) and receive notifications if the user wanders into restricted areas, ensuring their safety. In the case the user is found in a red or yellow zone, caregivers are notified immediately. Caregivers can use the program to call for Uber/Lyft services to safely bring the user back home if they are unable to return on their own.</p>
